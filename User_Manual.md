How to report a bug. This should include not just the mechanics (a pointer to your issue tracker), but also what information is needed. You can set up a bug-report template in your issue tracker, or you can reference a resource about how to write a good bug report. Here is an example for bug reporting guidelines. - Adam
Known bugs. Known bugs or limitations should be documented in the bug tracker. A user testing the implemented use case(s) should not encounter trivial bugs (e.g., NPEs) or a large number of bugs that are unlisted in your bug tracker. - Yantong
There is a deployment issue with getting macOS running. Chrome is the only working version of the app so far.
The filter page, explore(events) page, matchmaking page, and profile page are currently static.

# tapin-uw

TapIn@UW is an innovative social network designed specifically for UW students, alumni and faculty. Its
main goal and mission is to connect students on campus events, sports, and meetups while offering a
unique matchmaking system for academic, social and extracurricular activities. TapIn also features a
proprietary filtering algorithm that allows students to discover personalized events, new people, and
resources tailored to their interests and majors. Users will create their profile that will highlight their
interests which helps the app find their best fit with students. With a focus on security, TapIn ensures that
students are verified and connected within a safe environment. The platform aims to expand beyond UW,
with future plans to adapt it for other universities.
